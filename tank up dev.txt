~ [d1, 10:50] simple terrain + basic movement; camera still not attached
~ [d1, 11:12] camera attached
~ [d1, 12:50] basic data structures layed down; started working on interactions (random loot object)
~ [d1, 14:50] added sample loot to test gaining layers; added sample bomb to test loss of health points
~ [d1, 17:00] midcode - layer shedding time
~ [d1, 20:26] dropping bombs now; layering up and down is kinda OK; working on the enemies
~ [d1, 23:10] enemies ready for improvement - trying to follow the player; still don;t know how to shoot
~ [d2, 15:25] finally destroying enemies as supposed
